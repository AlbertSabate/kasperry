# Disable SWAP
As a requirement of kubernetes installation, we have to disable SWAP, since it can cause unexpected problems with kubelet.

Usually in ubuntu for raspberry is already off, but to make sure let's run:

```bash{outputLines: 2-3,5}
sudo swapoff -a

# Open fstab and if we have some line with swap, comment it out.
sudo vim /etc/fstab
# Remember! To save and quit vim use: ctrl+c and :wq.
```
