# Disable SWAP
As a requirement of kubernetes installation, we have to disable SWAP, since it can cause unexpected problems with kubelet.

`sudo swapoff -a`

then we edit the following file `/etc/fstab` and we have to comment the swap line, if is there. In my case is not there, so no need to do more steps.
