# Installing Raspberry PI
Choosing Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 64bits to set-up the cluster.

You can download the following image for RPI:
[Install Ubuntu Server on a Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 4 | Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)

To install it in the SD Card we can execute the following commands: (Using MacOS)

```bash{outputLines: 2,4}
diskutil list
# Check the list to see what is your disk and partition number, in my case is /dev/sda2
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/sda2
# Now we have to know where we download the ubuntu image and we have to pass as a param
sudo sh -c 'gunzip -c ~/Downloads/ubuntu20.04.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sda2 bs=32m'
```

This can take time, don't be scared if you don't see anything.
If you get really impatient you can press `ctrl+t` to print the current status.

Once this is done we already can eject the SD Card: 
`diskutil eject /dev/sda2`.

Now, we are ready to insert the SD Card into the Raspberry PI, and let the magic happens! :D

*Reminders*

To access to the raspberry pi you can do
`ssh ubuntu@<IP_ADDRESS>` with the password `ubuntu`.

If you are using another OS, you can refer to ubuntu download page and follow the official tutorial.
