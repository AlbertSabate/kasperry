# Installing Raspberry PI
Choosing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64bits

Download the following image for RPI:
[Install Ubuntu Server on a Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 4 | Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)

To install it in the SD Card we can execute the following commands:

`diskutil list`
`diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk< drive address number >`
`sudo sh -c 'gunzip -c ~/Desktop/< image file > | sudo dd of=/dev/disk< drive address number > bs=32m'`

This can take time, don't be scared if you don't see anything is happening.
If you get really impatient you can press `ctrl+t` and is going to show you the current status.

Do not cancel it! Be patient, it takes around 10 to 15 min.

Once this is done we already can eject the SD Card: 
`diskutil eject /dev/disk< drive address number >`

Now, we are ready to insert the SD Card into the Raspberry PI, and let the magic happens! :D

*Reminders*

To access to the raspberry pi you can do
`ssh ubuntu@<IP_ADDRESS>` with the password `ubuntu`.
