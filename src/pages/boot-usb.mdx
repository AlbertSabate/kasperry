# Booting Raspberry PI 4 from USB
Before to start we need to have some requirements

## Requirements
* Ubuntu 20.04 freshly installed on the SD Card [Install Ubuntu](/install-raspberry)
* Ubuntu 20.04 freshly installed on the SSD Drive [Install Ubuntu](/install-raspberry)

## Configuring Ubuntu to use the SSD as a root partition
We have to make the point clear. We are booting using the SD Card and mounting the SSD as a main partition.

### What does that mean?
It means we cannot remove the SD Card, and the boot it happens using the SD Card.


### Starting
Make sure we don't update anything before we change the boot to use the SSD.

* This is the boot partition: `/dev/mmcblk0p1` mounted at `/boot/firmware`. (This is the one we **always** use)
* This is the main partition: `/dev/mmcblk0p2` it will be no longer used.

First of all we execute:
```bash{outputLines: 2}
sudo fdisk -l
# Check if we have available our external USB drive.
```

In my SSD:
* This is the boot partition: `/dev/sda1`. **NEVER USED**
* This is the main partition: `/dev/sda2`. This is the one we will use for our root partition.

We can edit the boot to use the SSD.

Edit the file:
```bash{outputLines: 2}
sudo vim /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
# Replace the part `root=LABEL=writable` to `root=/dev/sda2`.
sudo reboot
```

Now, it is gonna be using our SSD Partition.

Confirm it with:
```bash{outputLines: 2}
df
# Check if /dev/sda2 is mounted.
```

Easy right? ðŸ™ƒ

## SUPER IMPORTANT NOTES
Now we have to understand how it works.

1. We see /dev/sda1 as boot partition.
2. **IS NOT TRUE**.
3. The real boot happens in `/dev/mmcblk0p1`.

So, when we update the kernel we have to make sure to mount `/dev/mmcblk0p1` as a boot partition and `/dev/sda2` as a root.

Is difficult, but we have to make sure we are doing it on this way. If not maybe you cannot boot again.

### Friendly note
Raspberry pi team is working in provide a new firmware to real boot using USB without any of this "hack".

Not yet here.
