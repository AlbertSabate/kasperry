# IPTables
Another requisite of kubernetes is give iptables the ability to see bridget traffic. We can achieve that by executing:

*Remember, you have to execute this as a root user*

```
modprobe br_netfilter

cat <<EOF > /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
EOF

sysctl --system
```
