# Creating user and remove default ubuntu
To create a new user, we can use the native command: `sudo adduser <user_name>` and follow the steps.

Once our new user is created we want to add it to sudo group. To be easier I just edit the file `/etc/group` and I add the new user to the group `adm` and `sudo`, check if you need to add in another existent group.

I also like to ssh using certificate, I feel more safe than using password. So I will create the file `/home/<new_user_name>/.ssh/authorized_keys` and copy my public ssh key. We can create one with the command `ssh-keygen`. We use the private key to do the login, public goes to server (file spcified before).

*remember change the owner to <new_user_name> with `sudo chown <new_user_name>:<new_user_name> /home/<new_user_name>/.ssh -R`*

Now we are ready to login with the new user, check we have the rights to do sudo and we can proceed to delete the ubuntu user, since is unsafe.

`deluser --remove-all-files ubuntu`

Finally as an optional step, we can disable access ssh with password, since we have configured our certificate.

`sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

We want to make sure the following lines are like this:
```bash
PermitRootLogin no

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no
```

We can configure a lot more stuff here, but I have my firewall, so I think at this stage we don't need more security steps.
