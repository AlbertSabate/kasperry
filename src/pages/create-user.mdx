# Creating user and remove default ubuntu
To create a new user, we can use the native command: 

```bash{outputLines: 2}
sudo adduser <user_name>
# Follow steps
```

Adding the user to admin groups.
```bash{outputLines: 1,3-4}
# Manually way to do it, since is a lot of groups. 
sudo vim /etc/group
# Add your new <user_name> to all groups which contains ubuntu.
# Separated by comma.
exit
```

Now you can access again using your new created user.

Also, We recommend to login to ssh using certificate, It feels more safe than using password.


We start by creating the certificate in our machine.
```bash{outputLines: 2-4}{promptHost: localhost}
ssh-keygen
# Follow steps
# It creates 2 files, copy all the content of your public cert.
# Usually id_rsa.pub
ssh <user_name>@kasperry.io
```

Time to configure our new certificate to the server.
```bash{outputLines: 3}
mkdir ~/.ssh
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Copy here the content of the newly created public key.
```

Check If the rights to do sudo are properly defined and then we can proceed to delete the ubuntu user, since is better not having it.

```bash{outputLines: 2}
deluser --remove-all-files ubuntu
# This will delete all files and folders of this user. Make sure you back-up everything before running it.
```

Finally, as an another recommended step.
We can disable access ssh using password, since we have already configured our certificate.

```bash{outputLines: 2-4}{promptHost: localhost}
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <user_name>@kasperry.io
```

Before to go to the next step try to access ssh using certificate.

```bash{outputLines: 2-8}
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# We want to make sure the following lines are like this:
# ---
PermitRootLogin no

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no
# ---
```

Everything is done here!
