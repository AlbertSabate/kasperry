# Kasperry Ï€

Kasperry PI wants to teach how to build a home cluster of kubernetes using Raspberry PI.
Also, we want to show we can use Raspberry PI with Kubernetes to serve a production environment application.

## Requirements
* Two Raspberry PI 4 or more.
* Master node has to be Raspberry PI 4 with 4Gb of RAM.
* Workers can be Raspberry PI 4 with minimum 2Gb of RAM.
* Use heat sink and fan in all Raspberry PI 4.
* We will use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

I strongly recommend use Raspberry PI 4 with 4Gb of RAM.

Please note, if you want to create the cluster with Raspberry PI 3 or Raspberry PI 4 (1Gb RAM), I recommend to use [k3s](https://k3s.io/).
