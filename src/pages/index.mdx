# The Kasperry Project

Kasperry pi project wants to teach how to build a home cluster of kubernetes using Raspberry pi.
Also, we want to show we can use raspberry pi with kubernetes to serve production environment web applications.

## Requirements
* three Raspberry pi or more.
* Master node has to be Raspberry pi 4 with 4Gb of RAM.
* Workers can be raspberry 4 with minimum 2Gb of RAM.
* Use heat sink and fan in all Raspberry PI.
* We will use ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

I strongly recommend use Raspberry PI 4 with 4Gb of RAM.

Please note, if we want to create the cluster with raspberry pi 3 or raspberry pi 4 (1Gb RAM), I recommend to use [k3s](https://k3s.io/).
