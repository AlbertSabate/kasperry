# Setting up Kubernetes with Calico

To initialize the cluster is really easy, we are going to use kubeadm to do it.

```bash{outputLines: 2}
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
# Really careful here to not conflict with your local network!!!!!!!!!!! That's SUPER IMPORTANT !!!!
```

We already have created our cluster.

```bash{outputLines: 1}
# To have access to our cluster using kubectl, run the following commands.
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Also, kubeadm provide us a join command. This command it should be executed in our worker nodes.

Finally, we should be able to execute the following command:

```bash{outputLines: 1}
# This apply Calico configurations
kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
```
