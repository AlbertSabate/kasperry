# Setting up the Hostname
To set the hostname we want to the raspberry pi we can execute the following command:

`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_host_name`

Now, we need to reboot the raspberry pi.

We can verify everything went right by executing `cat /etc/hostname`.

Friendly note 1: You should be able to resolve the hostname.
Friendly note 2: The IP of the host should be static, is not enough just using the hostname as domain.
Friendly note 3: Your hostname should be unique in the network.
